## 📂 Folder Structure

### 1. Intro
Learn the **fundamentals of C++**:
- What is C++ and its history  
- Character sets, tokens, literals, and operators  
- Input/Output basics  
- Simple example programs demonstrating basic syntax  

### 2. Core Concepts
Covers essential C++ topics:
- Data types and variables  
- Expressions and operators  
- Flow of control: if, switch, loops, jump statements  
- Functions (including `<ctime>`, `<limits>`, `<algorithm>`)  
- Arrays and Structures  
- Each topic includes **example programs**  

### 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Master OOP in C++:
- Classes & Objects  
- Constructors & Destructors (including overloading)  
- Operator Overloading  
- Polymorphism (function overloading and overriding)  
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hybrid, Hierarchical)  
- Visibility (public, protected, private)  
- Base class function overriding  
- Examples provided for every concept  

### 4. Advanced / Modern C++
Learn advanced C++ features:
- File handling (`fstream`)  
- Standard Template Library (STL): vector, map, algorithms  
- Modern C++ features: `auto`, `nullptr`, lambda, range-based for loops  
- Pointers, references, and dynamic memory (`new` / `delete`)  
- Const, inline, and type casting  

### 5. Hands-On Practice
Practice programs to **reinforce learning**:
- Question folder → problem statements  
- Answer folder → solved programs  
- Use these programs to **apply concepts and improve coding skills**
