1.2.6 Comments in C++

Comments are non-executable statements in a program.
They are used to describe the code and make it more readable.
The compiler ignores comments during execution.

Types of Comments:

1. Single-line Comment
- Starts with //
- Extends to the end of the line

Example:
int a = 10; // This is a single-line comment

2. Multi-line Comment
- Starts with /* and ends with */
- Can span multiple lines

Example:
/*
This is a
multi-line comment
*/

Purpose of Comments:
- Explain code logic
- Make code readable
- Temporarily disable code for testing
