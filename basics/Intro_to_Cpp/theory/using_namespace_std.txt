USING NAMESPACE STD

In C++, the standard library contains predefined objects and functions such as
cout, cin, endl, string, etc. All these are defined inside a namespace called
"std".

A namespace is used to group related names together and to avoid name conflicts
in large programs.

The statement:

using namespace std;

tells the compiler that we want to use all the names present inside the std
namespace directly, without writing std:: before each name.

Example without using namespace std:

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    std::cin.get();
    return 0;
}

Example with using namespace std:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}

Advantages:
- Makes the program simple and easy to read
- Reduces repetitive use of std::

Disadvantages:
- May cause name conflicts in large programs

Usage:
- Recommended for beginners and small programs
- In large or professional programs, it is better to use std:: explicitly

Conclusion:
The statement using namespace std; allows programmers to use standard library
objects like cout and cin easily and is commonly used in beginner-level C++
programs.
