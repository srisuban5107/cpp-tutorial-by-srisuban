1.6 Types of Errors in C++

Errors are problems in a program that prevent it from executing correctly.
Understanding different types of errors helps programmers debug code efficiently.

--------------------------------------------------

1. Compilation Errors (Syntax Errors)

Compilation errors occur when the code violates C++ syntax rules.
The compiler detects these errors and prevents the program from compiling.

Common Examples:
- Missing semicolon
int a = 10

- Misspelled keywords
intr main() { }

- Incorrect parentheses or braces
if(a > 5 {
    cout << a;
}

Solution:
- Check syntax carefully
- Fix errors indicated by the compiler

--------------------------------------------------

2. Linker Errors

Linker errors occur when the compiler generates object files, but the linker fails to combine them into an executable.

Common Causes:
- Undefined references to functions
- Missing libraries
- Multiple definitions

Example:
int main() {
    cout << add(5, 3);  // add() not defined
}

Solution:
- Ensure all functions are defined
- Include necessary libraries
- Avoid multiple definitions

--------------------------------------------------

3. Runtime Errors

Runtime errors occur while the program is running, even if it compiles successfully.
These errors cause the program to terminate unexpectedly.

Common Examples:
- Division by zero
int a = 5, b = 0;
cout << a / b;

- Invalid memory access (pointers)
- Array index out of bounds

Solution:
- Use checks and conditions
- Handle exceptions where possible

--------------------------------------------------

4. Logical Errors

Logical errors occur when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.
These errors are often the hardest to detect.

Examples:
- Incorrect formula or calculation
int sum = a - b;  // should be a + b

- Wrong loop conditions
for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++) { ... } // may exceed bounds

Solution:
- Trace program logic carefully
- Use debugging techniques

--------------------------------------------------

5. Semantic Errors

Semantic errors are similar to logical errors but specifically violate the meaning of the program.
The program may compile and run, but the output does not make sense.

Example:
int age = -5;  // logically invalid

Solution:
- Validate input and program logic
- Apply correct rules for data types

--------------------------------------------------

6. Summary Table of Errors

| Type of Error      | When Detected        | Example                                |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Compilation Error  | Compile-time       | Missing semicolon, misspelled keyword |
| Linker Error       | Link-time          | Undefined function, missing library   |
| Runtime Error      | Run-time           | Division by zero, invalid pointer     |
| Logical Error      | Run-time           | Wrong calculation, wrong loop logic   |
| Semantic Error     | Run-time           | Invalid data, wrong meaning           |

--------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

Understanding different types of errors helps in:
- Writing correct code
- Debugging efficiently
- Producing reliable programs

Beginners should practice detecting and fixing all types of errors to become confident programmers.
