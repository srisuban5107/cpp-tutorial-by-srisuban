1.2.2 Identifiers in C++

Identifiers are names given to program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, classes, and objects.
They are used to identify these elements uniquely in a program.

Examples of Identifiers
sum
totalMarks
studentName
calculateResult
main

Rules for Naming Identifiers
- An identifier must begin with a letter (a–z or A–Z) or an underscore (_).
- It cannot start with a digit.
- Only letters, digits, and underscore are allowed.
- Special characters such as @, #, $, % are not allowed.
- Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
- Identifiers are case-sensitive (sum and Sum are different).

Valid Identifiers
count
total_sum
_marks
student1
averageScore

Invalid Identifiers
1total        (starts with a digit)
total-marks  (contains special character)
float        (keyword)
total marks  (contains space)

Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful names.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for class names.
- Use uppercase letters for constants.

Examples:
totalMarks      → variable
calculateSum()  → function
StudentRecord   → class
MAX_SIZE        → constant

Conclusion
Identifiers improve program readability and maintainability.
Choosing proper identifier names is an important programming practice.
