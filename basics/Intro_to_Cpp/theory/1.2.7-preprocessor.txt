0.3.7 Preprocessor Directives in C++

Preprocessor directives are instructions given to the compiler before compilation.
They begin with the '#' symbol.

Common Preprocessor Directives:
- #include : To include header files
- #define  : To define constants or macros
- #ifdef, #ifndef, #endif : Conditional compilation

Example:
#include <iostream>
#define PI 3.14

Purpose:
- Include libraries
- Define symbolic constants
- Enable conditional compilation
