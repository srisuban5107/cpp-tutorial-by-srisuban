1.2.8 Whitespace and Newlines in C++

Whitespace characters are spaces, tabs, and newlines.
They are used to separate tokens and improve code readability.

Examples:
int a = 10;     // spaces between tokens
for(int i=0; i<5; i++) { }  // spaces and newline

Note:
- The compiler ignores extra whitespace and newlines.
- Proper indentation and spacing are for humans to read code easily.
