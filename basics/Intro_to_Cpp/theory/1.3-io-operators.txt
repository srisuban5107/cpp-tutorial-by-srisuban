1.3 Input/Output (I/O) Operators in C++

Input/Output operators are used to take input from the user and display output on the screen.
C++ provides these operators through the iostream library.

Include the library:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

--------------------------------------------------

1. Output Operator (<<)

The output operator (<<), also called the insertion operator, is used with cout to display information on the screen.

Syntax:
cout << expression;

Example:
int a = 10;
cout << "The value of a is " << a << endl;

Explanation:
- "The value of a is " is a string literal
- << sends each value to the output
- endl inserts a new line

Multiple Expressions:
cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;

--------------------------------------------------

2. Input Operator (>>)

The input operator (>>), also called the extraction operator, is used with cin to take input from the user.

Syntax:
cin >> variable;

Example:
int age;
cout << "Enter your age: ";
cin >> age;
cout << "Your age is " << age << endl;

Multiple Inputs:
int x, y;
cin >> x >> y;

--------------------------------------------------

3. Notes on I/O Operators

- Always include <iostream> and use namespace std or use std::cout/std::cin
- Operators << and >> can be chained for multiple values
- Input operator skips whitespace automatically
- For string input with spaces, use getline(cin, variable);

Example with getline:
string name;
cout << "Enter your full name: ";
getline(cin, name);
cout << "Hello, " << name << endl;

--------------------------------------------------

4. Common Mistakes

- Forgetting to include <iostream>
- Using cin >> for string with spaces
- Not ending cout lines properly (missing endl or '\n')

--------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

Input and Output operators are essential for interacting with the user.
Understanding how to use cout and cin effectively is one of the first steps in writing C++ programs.
