1.4 Execution of a C++ Program

Understanding the execution of a C++ program is important for beginners.
Every program follows a series of steps from writing code to producing output.

--------------------------------------------------

1. Steps in Execution

1. Writing the Program
- The programmer writes the source code in a text editor or IDE.
- The file is saved with a .cpp extension.

Example:
hello.cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

--------------------------------------------------

2. Preprocessing
- The preprocessor handles all the directives starting with #
- Examples: #include, #define
- It replaces header files and macros before compilation.

Example:
#include <iostream>
is replaced by the actual content of iostream.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Compilation
- The compiler converts the preprocessed code into machine-readable object code.
- It checks for syntax errors, type errors, and other compile-time issues.
- If errors exist, the program will not compile until they are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Linking
- The linker combines all object code files and library code into a single executable.
- Ensures all function calls and references are correctly connected.
- Produces the final executable file (example: hello.exe).

--------------------------------------------------

5. Execution / Running the Program
- The operating system loads the executable into memory.
- The program starts execution from the main() function.
- Each statement is executed sequentially unless control statements modify the flow.
- Output is displayed using cout or other output mechanisms.

--------------------------------------------------

6. Summary of Flow

7. Example Execution

Source Code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 5, b = 10;
    int sum = a + b;
    cout << "Sum = " << sum << endl;
    return 0;
}

Execution Output:
Sum = 15

Explanation:
- Preprocessor includes iostream
- Compiler converts code into object code
- Linker creates executable
- Program runs and displays the sum

--------------------------------------------------

Conclusion

Understanding the execution process helps programmers debug errors efficiently.
It explains how C++ code transforms from text into working programs.
Knowing this flow is fundamental for beginners learning C++.
