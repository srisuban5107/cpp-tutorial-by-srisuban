1.2 Lexical Units (Tokens) in C++

Lexical units, also called tokens, are the smallest meaningful elements of a C++ program.
During compilation, the compiler divides the source code into tokens to understand and analyze the program structure.

Types of Tokens in C++

1. Keywords
Keywords are reserved words that have predefined meanings in C++.
They cannot be used as identifiers.

Examples:
int, float, double, char, if, else, for, while, return, class, break, continue

2. Identifiers
Identifiers are names given to program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, and classes.

Examples:
sum, totalMarks, studentName, calculateResult

Rules for Identifiers:
- Must begin with a letter or underscore (_)
- Cannot start with a digit
- Cannot be a keyword
- Only letters, digits, and underscore are allowed

3. Literals
Literals are fixed values written directly in the program source code.
The value of a literal does not change during program execution.

Types of Literals:
- Integer literals: 10, -25, 100
- Floating-point literals: 3.14, 0.75
- Character literals: 'A', '9'
- String literals: "Hello", "C++"
- Boolean literals: true, false

4. Operators
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.

Examples:
Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %
Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
Logical operators: &&, ||, !

5. Punctuators (Separators)
Punctuators are symbols used to separate statements and expressions and to define program structure.

Examples:
;  ,  ( )  { }  [ ]

Conclusion
Every C++ program is formed using these lexical units.
Understanding tokens is essential for learning the basic structure and syntax of C++ programs.
